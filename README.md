**Project - Two Factor Authentication Through Morse Code Using Eye Blinks**

A succint definition of this project is - a security tool that could potentially avoid/stop keylogger attacks by harnessing Morse Code technology to override the singular keyboard communication for password systems.

Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) is the trilogy based on which security features are provided to numerous electronic devices. The confidentiality aspect is achieved by employing the concept of authentication. The various places where authentication is used, makes use of the traditional Personal Identification Number (PIN) based system where the user is bound to enter a PIN known just by the user to gain further access. One such attack that is used to gain access at the authentication level is the keylogger attack, which is a software program tracking the keystrokes of the user. To thwart this type of attacks, this security model is proposed, which is an additional layer to the existing PIN system, in which a gaze-based eye blinking PIN entering system is used to provide the second layer password using Morse code, where the characters are described by dots and dashes. The system takes morse code PIN using eye blinks. Inflating the traditional PIN entry method by appending it with a byzantine method of eye blinking technique using feature of Morse code to provide an enhanced security is the motivation behind this work.
